This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for Airline Data Analysis, covering the full data science workflow from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to building predictive models using machine learning. The project leverages Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and xgboost to manipulate data, create insightful visualizations, and train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Users can clone the repository, install the required dependencies in a virtual environment, and run the notebook with Jupyter to reproduce the analysis. The notebook demonstrates how to handle missing values, perform feature engineering, explore trends with correlation heatmaps and plots, and evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project is designed for anyone interested in understanding flight patterns, predicting delays, and learning end-to-end data science practices, and it is open for contributions under the MIT License.
